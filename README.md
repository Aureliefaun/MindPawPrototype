# MindPawPrototype

This is a prototype of a semi-working SwiftUI app,designed to motivate the user to achieve greatness by utilizing sprite pets, that I personally designed and created.  This project, as a whole, was a group effort.  I programmed the Zuazi file and the PetIntro file and helped with some of the other files.
